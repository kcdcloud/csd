##NPM
Node JS package manager, helps you to manage all the libraries your software relays on. You would define your needs in a file called package.json and run npm install in the command line... BANG your packages are downloaded and are ready to use. Could be used both for front-end and back-end.
##Gulp
Automation just like Grunt but instead of configurations you can write JavaScript with streams like it's a node application. Much better than Grunt.
##Webpack
The coolest kid in the town. It will bundle your app into other bundling patters so you can use all the libraries available in NPM right into your front-end code, load different modules and do many other things. It is amazingly flexible and can create strong development environments. Very trendy these days.
##Slush and Yeoman (bestpractise and tools)[yeoman generators](http://yeoman.io/generators/)
Project scaffolding systems. You can create starter projects with them. Not good that much, use a Github boilerplate instead.
##Express
Node JS web application framework. Could be used for routing and anything else needed is cover through middle wares. Very popular and beautifully designed so if you want to create a web application project with node, you are probably using it.
##Git
